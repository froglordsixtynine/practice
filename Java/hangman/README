hangman
Tom Li | Nov 2014

Simple Hangman game. The purpose was to practice:

1. general Java skills and data structures
2. building simple UI in Java using AWT
3. understanding the usage of .jar files

I did not care about:

1. aesthetics (for the most part)
2. using custom assets

I ended up learning the most about:

1. string operations and char arrays in Java.



5. AWT.

Surprisingly, I had way more trouble with doing String manipulations in
non-naive ways than I did with learning the UI stuff. Still need more
practice. I am sure keyTyped(), which manages the game, is suboptimal,
though it certainly could be a lot worse.
