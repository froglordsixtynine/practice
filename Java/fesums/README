fesums
Tom Li | 2014

fesums is a quick utility to sum the base max stats of each class in Fire Emblem: Awakening.
It was written to practice basic Java IO. It takes the max stat in each category from 
http://old.serenesforest.net/fe13/index.html, sums them, and writes the result to stdout.

It is uncommented, likely very bad (was quite out of practice at the time), and was written
in 1-2 hours.
